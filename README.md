# Data-analysis-Term-9
Data analysis and ML course, 1st term of master

[Seminar 2 homework. Linear regression.](https://github.com/sevlabr/Data-analysis-MIPT-Term-9/tree/main/Sem%202%20HW)
Homework dedicated to predicting pressure in Shanghai using linear model.

[Seminar 3 homework. Logistic regression.](https://github.com/sevlabr/Data-analysis-MIPT-Term-9/tree/main/Sem%203%20HW)
Predict whether pressure in Shanghai is lower than its median or not.

[Seminar 4 homework. Decision Trees and Random Forests.](https://github.com/sevlabr/Data-analysis-MIPT-Term-9/tree/main/Sem%204%20HW)
Predict salaries using sklearn and own implementation of Decision Tree.

[Seminar 5 homework. SVM and kNN.](https://github.com/sevlabr/Data-analysis-MIPT-Term-9/tree/main/Sem%205%20HW)
Transform non-linear data in such a way that it can be processed successfully by SVM with linear kernel. Compare results with kNN.

[Seminar 6 homework. Metrics.](https://github.com/sevlabr/Data-analysis-MIPT-Term-9/tree/main/Sem%206%20HW)
Plot ROC, PR, Precision(threshold) and Recall(threshold) curves using given dataset and model with changing threshold. Solve the task analytically.
